A simple and elegant **Counter App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value — and it **remembers your last count** even after refreshing the page using `localStorage`.

## 🧠 How It Works

- On page load, the app checks for a saved count value in localStorage.
- If a value exists, it displays it immediately.
- The +1 and –1 buttons modify the count and update localStorage.
- The Reset button sets the count back to zero and saves it again.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects on button click
- Include custom step values (e.g., +5 / -5)
- Add dark & light mode toggle
